gr-audio-windows will add an audio-sink to gnuradio for windows

Requirements for building:
make sure you have the following installed:
mingw
libtool (recent version ,built yourself, (if needed remove old libtool macros from /usr/share/aclocal))
msys
python2.4 (just install the prebuild binary for windows)
boost  (built yourself, maybe just unpacking the source somewhere will do, we only use header files)
cppunit (built yourself)
gnuradio-core (built with mingw)

Building:
sources from cvs:
edit bootstrap to your needs (see below for example)
./bootstrap 
./configure /configure --with-cppunit-prefix=/whereiscppunit --with-boost-include-dir=/c/whereisboost PYTHON=/c/Python24/python am_cv_python_pythondir=/c/Python24/Lib/site-packages am_cv_python_pyexecdir=/c/Python24/Lib/site-packages
make
make check
make install


If you have multiple versions of aclocal then edit bootstrap and change aclocal and automake to the latest version

You really need a recent libtool to get this built on mingw.
If you build it with default options it will be placed in /usr/local, but the default libtool will still be in /usr.
This will result in old m4 macros will be used by aclocal.
So if you have a more recent libtool installed in /usr/local add -I /usr/local/share/aclocal to the aclocal commandline in bootstrap.
(And add any other directories with the most recent m4 macros)
You could also uninstall (delete) the old libtool macros in /usr/share/aclocal

bootstrap example:

!/bin/sh
rm -fr config.cache autom4te*.cache
aclocal-1.8 -I /usr/local/share/aclocal -I config
autoconf
autoheader
libtoolize --automake
automake-1.8 --add-missing


configuration example:
./configure --with-cppunit-prefix=/usr/local --with-boost-include-dir=/d/boost_1_32_0/include/boost-1_32 PYTHON=/d/Python24/python am_cv_python_pythondir=/d/Python24/Lib/site-packages am_cv_python_pyexecdir=/d/Python24/Lib/site-packages
