The instructions below are now obsolete.  Please see:

======
OBSOLETED

These instructions are intended for Linux. On other systems you will have to
construct something compatible to build gr-audio-portaudio.

In order to use portaudio with gnuradio you will need to download and install
a late version of portaudio.  Please cd to a directory where the cvs command
below will be allowed to build the portaudio directory tree.

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@www.portaudio.com:/home/cvs co -r v19-devel portaudio

This will make a directory portaudio unless you already have one.  It will
check out the Portaudio API version 2 release 1.9.

In the directory where this README is found, there is a patch file.  Hopefully
this patch will not be needed for long.  Portaudio is working with us to use
auto*, libtool, etc.  The patch is autoconfiscate.patch.  

cd to the portaudio directory and run

patch -p0 <autoconfiscate.patch

this will modify the portaudio source tree to use standard tools and prepare
it for use with gnuradio.  Now run

chmod u+x bootstrap

you may need to edit bootstrap and remove the 2.50 at the end of some of the
commands (on SUSE 10.0 for example).

./bootstrap

./configure --help 


will reveal the options for configure that are available to you. If you do not
understand the options or wish to accept the defaults please just run

./configure

If you do not want the includes and libraries install in /usr/local (standard)
then enter the prefix arguments to ./configure.  This document will assume you
are doing the standard installation and that will be into /usr/local.

On Linux if you have the jack tool available from 

http://jackit.sourceforge.net

the portaudio configure will enable the library to talk to jack.

Now you are ready to make the portaudio library.

make; sudo make install;sudo ldconfig  (possibly /sbin/ldconfig).

will make the code and install it into the prefix (/usr/local) selected and
will cache the configuration information for other programs to use for their
configuration options.

Now you are ready to install gr-audio-portaudio.  In the gr-build directory
you may run

cvs co gr-audio-portaudio

cd gr-audio-portaudio
../buildit

will configure, make, and install the portaudio sink and source.

In gnuradio-examples/python/audio please test by running

./mono_tone_portaudio.py


If this runs you are likely in business but this chooses the default device
(typically /dev/dsp which is being run by alsa under oss emulation and on a
Mac it will choose coreaudio).

./mono_tone_portaudio.py -O hw:0,0

chooses the default alsa device.

./mono_tone_portaudio.py -O /dev/dsp

will force the use of OSS and the default oss device. To run with jack,  you
will probably enter the following command:

./mono_tone_portaudio.py -O alsa_pcm


In the portaudio directory,  you may list the devices visible to portaudio by
searching for and running the command

pa_devs
