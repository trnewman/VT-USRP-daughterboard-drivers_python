changes in gnuradio-3.0rc1 relative to gnuradio-core-2.8 and related tarballs:

* We moved the source code repository from CVS on savannah.gnu.org to
  subversion on gnuradio.org
* The build system was restructured such that there is now a single
  top-level configure.  See ./configure --help for details.  All
  top-level components may be required or excluded via configure
  options.  By default configure includes all components for which the
  dependencies are satisifed.
* There is now uniform handling for a variety of digital modulations
  and demodulations including gmsk, dbpsk and dqpsk.
* dbpsk and dqpsk now work!  dqpsk still has a higher error-rate than
  it should.
* gr-radio-astronomy now has very cool code for observing pulsars!
* gr-trellis: new module implementing a variety of forward error
correction techniques.  See gnuradio-examples/python/channel-coding
* gnuradio-core, usrp and gr-usrp now build and run under Cygwin.
* Fixed 52 bugs
