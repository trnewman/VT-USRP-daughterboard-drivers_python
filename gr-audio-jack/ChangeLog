	* gr-audio-jack.conf: new config file.
	* src/audio_jack_source.{h,cc}, src/audio_jack_sink.{h,cc}: added
	ok_to_block ctor argument (currently ignored).  Also query prefs
	for default input and output device names.

	* src/audio_jack_{source,sink}.cc: don't use jack_get_client_name
	since older jack versions don't have it.

2005-10-09  Stephane Fillod <f8cfe@free.fr>

	* src/audio_jack_{source,sink}.cc: fix, don't retrieve jack buffer 
	when ringbuffer overflows/underflows.
