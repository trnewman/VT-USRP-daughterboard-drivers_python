# This module upconverts the 19.2e6 sample rate signal from a center
# of 0 to 5.75e6 and converts to float, to prepare the signal for
# the old gnuradio 0.9 block (bit timing loop, field sync checker,
# equalizer and field sync demux), effectively simulating an
# mc4020 card, except the sample rate is 19.2e6 instead of 20e6.
#
# The signal is then centered on 5.75e6 with edges at 5.75 + 3.2 = 8.95MHz
# and 5.75 - 3.2 = 2.55Mhz, low pass filtered with cutoff at 9Mhz and a
# transition band width of 1Mhz.
#
# Input complex -3.2 to 3.2Mhz, output float 2.55 to 8.95Mhz.
