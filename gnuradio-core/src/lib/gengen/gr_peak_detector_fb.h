 * \brief Detect the peak of a signal

 * \param threshold_factor_rise The threshold factor determins when a peak
 *        has started. An average of the signal is calculated and when the 
 *        value of the signal goes over threshold_factor_rise*average, we
 *        start looking for a peak.
 * \param threshold_factor_fall The threshold factor determins when a peak
 *        has ended. An average of the signal is calculated and when the 
 *        value of the signal goes bellow threshold_factor_fall*average, we 
 *        stop looking for a peak.
 * \param look_ahead The look-ahead value is used when the threshold is
 *        found to look if there another peak within this step range.
 *        If there is a larger value, we set that as the peak and look ahead
 *        again. This is continued until the highest point is found with
 *        This look-ahead range.
 * \param alpha The gain value of a moving average filter
