 * \brief Implements a PLL which locks to the input frequency and outputs a carrier
 * \ingroup clock
 *
 * input: stream of complex; output: stream of complex
 *
 * This PLL locks onto a [possibly noisy] reference carrier on
 * the input and outputs a clean version which is phase and frequency
 * aligned to it.
 * 
 * All settings max_freq and min_freq are in terms of radians per sample, 
 * NOT HERTZ.  Alpha is the phase gain (first order, units of radians per radian) 
 * and beta is the frequency gain (second order, units of radians per sample per radian)
