This directory holds filtering code, some of which is machine
generated.  Which variations are generated is controlled by two
variables.  For most everything, the global "signatures"
in generate_utils.py controls.

For GrFreqXlatingFIRfilter<foo>, the global "fx_signatures" in
generate_GrFreqXlatingFIRfilterXXX.py controls.
